# NLP PROJECT
#Main Topic: Sentimental Analysis

# Sub-Topic: Restaurant-Evaluation
This is a project about evaluation of restaurants online. It checks what people are saying about the menu and if they enjoyed their food, which can also include the quality of services they were offered.
Since sentimental analysis is nowadays greatly being used by companies to identify the emotions(positive or negative) of people, this project intends to focus on getting a feel on what people think. Using this concept, this project will be aimed at improving the services offered in restaurants and could also include restaurants that deliver at home. Information will be collected to know the opinions of people and the impact of these opinions and their influence.
