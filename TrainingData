NEUTRAL Went here for brunch but was disappointed to learn that the "waffle" at duck and waffle is only served during late night.
POSITIVE The view was beautiful and showcased the whole of London.
POSITIVE When we arrived, I have to admit, even though I knew the restaurant was on the 40th floor, it still surprises me, the view was incredible.

POSITIVE Oh and the starter of crispy pig ears was a standout.
NEUTRAL Took my sister to Duck and Waffle as a birthday present, and I think it was a bit overrated.
NEGATIVE So the menu is quite strange, in some ways destructured, so you would probably end up like us asking the waiter: "What do you usually suggest?".

POSITIVE So portions are good, you can actually share in two as we did with no problem.

NEUTRAL Instead when the glass elevator had whooshed us up to Heron Tower's 40th floor, we walked into a bar and restaurant which was pumping high volume electro tunes into a space which was absolutely packed with people.
NEUTRAL Yet they were not ordinary people who had just finished a night out and were in search for something slightly more appetising then a donor kebab in their after-party, post-drunk, pre-hung over states like us.
